          At the beginning of September 2017, I began working with three other developers on Inter.Codes,
          our senior-design project at Gonzaga University.  Inter.Codes is a platform established by a small company
          named Liquid Crystal Studios, and seeks to serve as an all-in-one solution for software developers.  It is a
          cloud-based development environment, version control system, and project management suite that aims to
          produce collaboration and visibility into all aspects of the development process.  As part of the LCS team,
          I focused primarily on frontend design and development, building the components of the UI and interaction
          with our backend API.  Although Inter.Codes is still a work-in-progress, feel free to sign up for an account and get
          started <a class="inlineLink" href="https://dev.inter.codes">here</a>.

          I began working at C-Labs as a software development intern during the summer of 2016 when they were
          still considered to be a startup.  Since then, they've been acquired by TRUMPF, one of the world's
          largest providers of machine tools, and I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of cool projects.
          Much of my experience has involved creating plugins for the C-DEngine, C-Labs'
          state-of-the-art "real" industrial IoT service.  I've developed solutions that have allowed users to receive audio
          notifications on property updates, send data to an external SQL Server and Oracle database, and view a visual
          display of a stacklight sensor.  My contributions also include writing comprehensive documentation on various
          C-DEngine developer topics.  View what C-Labs is up to <a class="inlineLink" href="https://www.c-labs.com/news.html">here</a>.

          Since I was young, I've always had a passion for filming and editing video, as well as
          producing music.  In high school, I played guitar in various bands and later learned
          how to produce music electronically in DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) such as Logic, Ableton Live, and Pro Tools.
          During the past couple of years, I've produced music under the name "T.FAR" on SoundCloud as
          well as a DJ/Producer duo with Will Miner called "NERVES".  We've performed at various
          venues around the Spokane area, including a theatre festival with an audience of over 500 people.
          Our tracks have been played thousands of times on SoundCloud, with our most popular almost reaching 10k.
          In addition to solely producing music, I've filmed and edited a collection of guitar covers on YouTube, with
          one of my videos grossing 21,000 views.  Check out my channel
